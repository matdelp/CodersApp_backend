# ðŸ’» Coders App â€“ ExpressJS API

This is a full-featured **RESTful API built with Express.js**, developed as part of the Code Labs Academy web development bootcamp. The application handles **authentication**, **profile management**, **challenge creation**, **grading**, **leaderboards**, and **user statistics** for a coding platform.

This project emphasizes route/controller/service architecture with **Joi-based request validation**, setting the foundation for scalable Express applications.

> ðŸ§ª NOTE: Some services are stubbed or planned for future integration as part of the course progression
